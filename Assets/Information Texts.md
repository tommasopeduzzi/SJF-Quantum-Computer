### First Layer	
The main goal of most of the structure of a quantum computer is to cool down and protect the quantum chip. A structure known as a dilution fridge handles the cooling aspect of the operation. This is the first level of the dilution fridge. Here the temperature is 3 °K or -270.15 °C. 

### Second Layer
This level is another step towards absolute zero, it is at 0.9 °K. Here lie the electronics and machines to send and carry the signals to the quantum chip and to amplify the data set back by the Qubits. These electronics are mostly made up of commercially available amplifiers and signal generators. The signals, consisting of microwaves, go through neodymium superconductor wires. 

### Third Layer
This is the third level of the dilution fridge, at 0.1 °K. One of the main challenges of building a commercially viable quantum computer is to reduce interference, as even a small amount will cause signal corruption at extremely low temperatures needed for the superconducting phenomena. This is is why is hung from a support structure with air cushions to prevent any vibration and covered by an outer shell to protect against radiation and to isolate the machine from any other kind of interference.

### Fourth Layer
The fourth level of the fridge brings the temperature down to the final 0.015 °K. The fridge uses the process of rapidly depressurizing a mixture of helium 4 and 3 to cool the quantum computer. This process causes the iconing "breathing" sound produced by operating quantum computers.

### Fifth Layer
This is the fifth and final layer, it is home to the Qubit chip at a mind numbing 15 °mK, colder then outer space. This is the most protected part of the quantum computer, with shielding from radiation, vibration, and heat. The quantum chip is made up of a PCB on which are the physical qubits are laid out in a latticed pattern to permit entanglement. These qubits react and transform the microwave signals allowing them to be used for computing with the benefit of using their quantum nature.
